# CC Final Project - Mastery of Cloud Persona and Tools

## Chosen Persona

For this project, we decided to take on the persona of the **Dev-Ops Engineer**, while also dabbling
a bit in the **AI Engineer** persona. Dev-Ops engineers are in charge of creating solutions that
assist in the development process, and that is what we aimed to accomplish. Having good communication
between team members is key when developing any software application. This communication is hindered
when team members with disabilities like _prosopagnosia_ are unable to recognize the faces of their
peers, which can lead to confusion for all parties involved when discussing the team's work. Because
video chats are so common these days due to the ongoing pandemic, we decided to create a solution
that would alleviate these issues in a video chat environment. Thus, we created a live facial
recognition tool with the potential to integrate into video chats to better streamline the
communication between team members and make the team environment more accessible.

Naturally, given that this is a facial recognition tool, there is also some machine learning
involved, hence the **AI Engineer** persona that was touched on earlier. However, given that we
utilized a library that took care of most of the machine learning for us, the **AI Engineer**
persona was not the primary focus of this project.

## Tools and Technologies

To keep true to the assignment at hand, we deployed our site through Azure Websites to deliver a
responsive experience to the user. Also, in order to boost the performance of the facial recognition,
the machine learning models for facial detection were loaded in the cloud prior to deployment, thus
making use of the distributed computing and speed of Azure. The intent was to keep to the concept of
_facilitating communication and collaboration_, which is one of the key concepts highlighted by the
Azure Dev-Ops certification page. Leveraging cloud resources to create a clean, fast, and responsive
user experience, we did just that.
